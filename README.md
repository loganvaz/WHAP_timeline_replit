This was a project created in hopes of being helpful for studying World History. It is an interactive timeline that can sort based on topic, region, and time period. 
# This project includes
* a list of many historical events with time period, region, and theme noted (as well as a reference to ABBA's Waterloo w/ Napoleon's defeat)
* a timeline which can be switched between multiple periods
* the ability to toggle events to select based on region and topic
* color coding with respect to the topic to enable easier visualizations (in future, might want to include other signs b/c many have multiple topics)
* the ability to rescale the timeline via a box and submit button
* clear indication of location and time of events (sorted on timeline) 
* a title and description of each event


# Future changes would include:
* better data (what have is from my quick look over a textbook)
* cleaner visualization (replacing text under title with the hover tool [wouldn't be hard to implement, just thought of after creation and am currently working on different projects], clearer labels, better color choice)
* interactive time period elements
* changing the rescale option to a sliding bar instead
* indicating important empires spans above the timeline (maybe also stuff like Enlightenment or Bubonic Plague and such)
* deploying with google app engine and using python/SQL to allow users to create their own events and/or add from distirbutions kept (such as this one, maybe could be called "base 0")
